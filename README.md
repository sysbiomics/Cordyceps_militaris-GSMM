# Cordyceps_militaris-GEM

- Brief Repository Description

This repository contains a genome-scale metabolic model **iNR1329** for _Cordyceps militaris_.

- Abstract:
_Cordyceps militaris_ is an entomopathogenic fungus which is often used in Asia as a traditional medicine developed from age-old wisdom. Presently, cordycepin from _C. militaris_ is a great interest in medicinal applications. However, cellular growth of _C. militaris_ and the association with cordycepin production remain poorly understood. To explore the metabolism of _C. militaris_ as potential cell factories in medical and biotechnology applications, this study developed a high-quality genome-scale metabolic model of _C. militaris_, **iNR1329**, based on its genomic content and physiological data. The model included a total of 1,329 genes, 1,821 biochemical reactions, and 1,171 metabolites among 4 different cellular compartments. Its _in silico_ growth simulation results agreed well with experimental data on different carbon sources. iNR1329 was further used for optimizing the growth and cordycepin overproduction using a novel approach, **POPCORN**, for rational design of synthetic media. In addition to the high-quality GEM iNR1329, the presented POPCORN approach was successfully used to rationally design an optimal synthetic medium with C:N ratio of 8:1 for enhancing 3.5-fold increase in cordycepin production. This study thus provides a novel insight into _C. militaris_ physiology and highlights a potential GEM-driven method for synthetic media design and metabolic engineering application. The iNR1329 and the POPCORN approach are available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/sysbiomics/Cordyceps_militaris-GEM.
